You're a document analysis expert who is comparing two different markdown samples to an image to see which one represents the content of the image better. The markdown will be called version A and version B.

Here are some notes on the image and markdown:
- Some parts of the page may have been recognized as images and linked from the markdown, like `![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)`.
- Tables will be formatted as Github flavored markdown.
- Block equations will be in LaTeX.
- The image and markdown may be in any language.
- The markdown is based on the text extracted from the document, and sometimes the document may have had bad OCR applied to it, resulting in gibberish text.

The markdown should fully capture the meaning and formatting of the text in the image. You'll evaluate the markdown based on the image provided.

**Instructions**
Follow this process to evaluate the markdown:
1. Carefully examine the image.
2. Carefully examine the first markdown input provided.
3. Describe how well version a represents the image.
4. Carefully examine the second markdown input provided.
5. Describe how well version B represents the image.
6. Compare version A and version B.
7. Decide which markdown representation is better, based on the criteria below.  Output version_a if version a is better, and version_b if version b is better.

Use these criteria when judging the markdown:
- Overall - the overall quality of the markdown as compared to the image.
- Text quality - the quality of the text extraction from the image.
- Formatting quality - the quality of the formatting applied to the markdown, as compared to the image.
- Tables - how effectively the tables have been extracted and formatted.
- Forms - how effectively the forms have extracted and formatted.
- Equations - how effectively block equations have been converted to LaTeX.
- Lists - if the lists have been properly extracted and formatted.
- Images - if images are identified and placed correctly.

Notes on scoring:
- Perfect markdown will include all of the important text from the image, and the formatting will be correct (minor mistakes okay).  It's okay to omit some text that isn't important to the meaning, like page numbers and chapter headings.  If the entire page is an image, it's okay if the markdown is just a link to the image, unless the image would be better represented as text.
- Bad markdown will have major missing text segments from the markdown or completely unreadable formatting.  It may also have key values that are different from the values in the image.

Output json, like in the example below.

**Example**
Version A
```markdown
# *Section 1*
This is some *markdown* extracted from a document.  Here is a block equation:
$$\frac{ab \cdot x^5 + x^2 + 2 \cdot x + 123}{t}$$
```
Version B
```markdown
# Section 1
This is some markdown extracted from a document.  Here is a block equation:
$$\frac{ab \cdot x^5 + x^2 + 2 \cdot x + 124}{t}$$
```
Output
```json
{
    "image_description": "In the image, there is a section header 'Section 1', followed by some text and a block equation.",
    "version_a_description": "In the markdown, there is a section header 'Section 1', followed by some text and a block equation.",
    "version_b_description": "In the markdown, there is a section header 'Section 1', followed by some text and a block equation.  The formatting in version b is slightly different from the image.  The value 124 is also different from the image.",
    "comparison": "Version A is better than version B.  The text and formatting in version A matches the image better than version B.  Version B also has an incorrect value.",
    "winner": "version_a",
}
```
**Input**
Version A
```markdown
{{version_a}}
```
Version B
```markdown
{{version_b}}
```
**Output**
