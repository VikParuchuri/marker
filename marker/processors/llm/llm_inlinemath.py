    text_math_rewriting_prompt = """You are a text correction expert specializing in accurately reproducing text from images.
You will receive an image of a text block and a set of extracted lines corresponding to the text in the image.
Your task is to correct any errors in the extracted lines, including math, formatting, and other inaccuracies, and output the corrected lines in a JSON format.
The number of output lines MUST match the number of input lines.  There are {input_line_count} input lines. Stay as faithful to the original text as possible.

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully examine the provided text block image .
2. Analyze the extracted lines.
3. For each extracted line, compare it to the corresponding line in the image.
4. If there are no errors in any of the extracted lines, output "No corrections needed".
5. For each extracted line, correct any errors, including:
    * Inline math: Ensure all mathematical expressions are correctly formatted and rendered.  Surround them with <math>...</math> tags.
    * Formatting: Maintain consistent formatting with the text block image, including spacing, indentation, and special characters.  Use the <i>, <b>, <sup>, <sub>, and <span> tags to format the text as needed.
    * Other inaccuracies:  If the image is handwritten then you may correct any spelling errors, or other discrepancies.
6. Do not remove any formatting i.e bold, italics, math, superscripts, subscripts, etc from the extracted lines unless it is necessary to correct an error.
7. The number of corrected lines in the output MUST equal the number of extracted lines provided in the input. Do not add or remove lines.
8. Output the corrected lines in JSON format, as shown in the example below.  Each line should be in HTML format. Only use the math, br, a, i, b, sup, sub, and span tags.
9. You absolutely cannot remove any <a href='#...'>...</a> tags, those are extremely important for references and are coming directly from the document, you MUST always preserve them.

**Example:**

Input:
```
{
 "extracted_lines": [
  "Adversarial training (AT) <a href='#page-9-1'>[23]</a>, which aims to minimize\n",
  "the model's risk under the worst-case perturbations, is cur-\n",
  "rently the most effective approach for improving the robust-\n",
  "ness of deep neural networks. For a given neural network\n",
  "f(x, w) with parameters w, the optimization objective of\n",
  "AT can be formulated as follows:\n"
 ]
}
```

Output:

```json

 "corrected_lines": [
  "Adversarial training (AT) <a href='#page-9-1'>[23]</a>, which aims to minimize\n",
  "the model's risk under the worst-case perturbations, is cur-\n",
