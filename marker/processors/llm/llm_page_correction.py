    page_prompt = """You're a text correction expert specializing in accurately reproducing text from PDF pages. You will be given a JSON list of blocks on a PDF page, along with the image for that page.  The blocks will be formatted like the example below.  The blocks will be presented in reading order.

```json
[
    {
        "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
        "id": "/page/0/Text/1",
        "block_type": "Text",
        "html": "<p>Some text here</p>",
    }, ...
]
```

You will also be given a prompt from the user that tells you how to correct the blocks.  Your task is to analyze the blocks and the image, then follow the prompt to correct the blocks.

Here are the types of changes you can make in response to the prompt:

- Reorder the blocks to reflect the correct reading order.
- Change the block type to the correct type - the potential types are "SectionHeader", "Form", "Text", "Table", "Figure", "Picture", "ListGroup", "PageFooter", "PageHeader", "Footnote", or "Equation".  In this case, update the html as well to match the new block type.
- Make edits to block content by changing the HTML.

Guidelines:
- Only use the following tags: {{format_tags}}.  Do not use any other tags.  
- The math tag can have `display="block"`, the a tag can have `href="..."`, the img tag can have `src="..."`, and td and th can have `colspan="..."` and `rowspan="..."`. There can be a "block-type" attribute on p tags. Do not use any other attributes.
- Keep LaTeX formulas inside <math> tags - these are important for downstream processing.
- Preserve the original language and every existing <img src="..."> inside table cells. Keep each image in its original cell; do not replace it with a description.
- Compare Greek symbols, subscripts, superscripts and fractions with the page image. Preserve distinct symbols such as \\phi and \\varphi as printed.
- Bboxes are normalized 0-1000
- The order of the JSON list is the reading order for the blocks
- Follow the user prompt faithfully, and only make additional changes if there is a significant issue with correctness.
- Stay faithful to the original image, and do not insert any content that is not present in the image or the blocks, unless specifically requested by the user prompt.

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully examine the provided JSON representation of the page, along with the image.
2. Analyze the user prompt.
3. Identify any issues you'll need to fix, and write a short analysis.
4. If everything is fine, output "no_corrections"  Otherwise, output the type of correction needed: ["reorder", "rewrite", "reorder_first"].  Rewrite includes rewriting html and changing the block type.  If you need to do both, then perform only the reordering, and output "reorder_first", so we can do the rewriting later.
5. If corrections are needed, output any blocks that need updates:
    a. If reading order needs to be changed, output the IDs of the blocks in the correct order, and keep block_type and html blank, like this:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "id": "/page/0/Text/1",
            "block_type": "",
            "html": ""
        },
        ...
    ]

    b. If blocks need to be rewritten, output the block ids and new HTML for the blocks, like this:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "id": "/page/0/Text/1",
                "block_type": "Text",
                "html": "<p>New HTML content here</p>"
            },
            ...
        ]
        ```

**Example:**
Input:
Blocks
```json
[
    {
        "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
        "id": "/page/0/Text/1",
        "block_type": "Text",
        "html": "1.14 Vector Operations",
    },
    {
        "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
        "id": "/page/0/Text/2",
        "block_type": "Text",
        "html": "<p>You can perform many operations on a vector, including...</p>",
    },
]
```
User Prompt
Ensure that all blocks have the correct labels, and that reading order is correct.
Output:
Analysis: The blocks are in the correct reading order, but the first block should actually be a SectionHeader.
```json
[
    {
        "id": "/page/0/Text/1",
        "block_type": "SectionHeader",
        "html": "<h1>1.14 Vector Operations</h1>"
    }
]

**Input:**
Blocks
```json
{{page_json}}
